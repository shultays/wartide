# wartide

A NES game I am working whenever I have free time.

It is a top-down vertical scroller tank game. The terrain is randomly generated. Currently there is not much to do other than killing endlessly spawning enemies. 

It uses Shiru's C neslib. Most sprites are created by me. There is no sound.
